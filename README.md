# Brute Force String Matching Algorithm:
Programmed a string matching algorithm that takes a string and pattern as input. It checks to see if the pattern is in the string and if so, it will return the position in the string in which the pattern starts. Time Complexity: O(n)


# Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm:
Algorithm I developed which recreates the Needleman-Wunsch Global Sequence Alignment Algorithm. This algorithm also uses the BLOSUM50 matrix for scoring and assumes a gap penalty of -8. Time Complexity: O(m*n)

# DSA More LeetCode Practice:
This file contains Python solutions that I developed in order to solve various LeetCode problems. Each solution has the problem number commented at the top. I also included in-depth comments to make it easy to follow my logic behind solving the problem. There is also Python code for a few common algorithms at the very end, such as DFS, BFS, and Binary Search.

This file contains more Python solutions that I developed in order to solve various LeetCode problems. Each solution has the problem number at the top with the description of the problem as well. I also included in-depth comments to make it easy to follow my logic behind solving the problem.


# Wordle Helper:
My friend introduced me to the daily Wordle game (made by The New York Times). I soon began playing it everyday since it is a fun game that tests my vocabularly and problem solving skills. I then decided to write a program to see if I could gain the edge in solving the Wordle using Python. This was a side project that I programmed for fun.
