# Brute Force String Matching Algorithm:
Programmed a string matching algorithm that takes a string and pattern as input. It checks to see if the pattern is in the string and if so, it will return the position in the string in which the pattern starts. Time Complexity: O(n)


# Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm:
Algorithm I developed which recreates the Needleman-Wunsch Global Sequence Alignment Algorithm. This algorithm also uses the BLOSUM50 matrix for scoring and assumes a gap penalty of -8. Time Complexity: O(m*n)
